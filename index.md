## About Me
---

Hi, I'm Kunal Dutta. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 with a B.A. in Computer Science.
I currently work for SoFi as a Software Development Engineer in San Francisco, CA.

Outside of professional endeavors, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, fitness, finding new places
to fuel my coffee addiction, making Spotify playlists, 
constantly thinking about Bay Area sports, music, and generally having fun.

My current goals are training for a Thanksgiving 5K run, surfing more often, learning guitar, and exploring
San Francisco to the best of my ability.
