## About Me
---

Hi, I'm Kunal Dutta. I currently work for SoFi as a Software Development Engineer in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 with a B.A. in Computer Science. I also spend time developing engineering projects indepedently.


Outside of professional endeavors, I enjoy being outdoors, fitness, reading, coffee, beer, sports bars, and am always looking for things to do in the Bay Area.
