## About Me

Hi, I'm Kunal Dutta. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 with a B.A. in Computer Science.
I currently work for SoFi as a Software Development Engineer.

Outside of professional endeavors, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, fitness, finding new places
to fuel my coffee addiction, constantly thinking about Bay Area sports, and generally having fun.
