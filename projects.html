<h5> Privacy Guard </h5>
<h6>November 2018</h6>
<p>
A browser extension that uses a magnetic field sensor to close 
all incognito tabs when the user's door is opened. Developed 
and built in 36 hours at CalHacks 5.0, from November 2-4, 2018. 
I built the mobile application (using Android Studio) associated with the 
project, which generated a unique ID that the user would enter in his 
browser to enable the sensor.
