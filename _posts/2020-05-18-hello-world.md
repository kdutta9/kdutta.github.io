Hello, World!

This is my first post to my redesigned website and newly created blog. I have recently completed my second year at UC Berkeley, and because of COVID-19,
my summer plans have taken a halt. So, for Summer 2020, I am looking to fully immerse myself in projects and personal development.
My plan is to blog about my process in developing projects and post educational content, and hopefully I can keep up with it.

So, today is a big day - it marks a start to an exciting summer ahead, and signifies a return to one of my first loves: writing. Through college so far, I regret
not writing as much as I would've liked to and I am looking to change that. Perhaps I can take advantage of the unfortunate times we are in.

To new beginnings!
