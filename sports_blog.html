	  I'm writing this in 10 minutes because I need something on here. 
	  I think about these a lot, so I'll write them down. I may or may 
	  not explain/defend these in a later post.
	  </p>
	  <p>1. Stephen Curry is the most impactful basketball player of all time.</p>
	  <p>2. As of 2019, Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the world.</p>
	  <p>3. The Sixers are better off not using Ben Simmons as a point guard.</p>
	  <p>4. The Rockets need to fire Mike D'Antoni for any chance at a championship.</p>
	  <p>5. LeBron and AD together beat the Warriors.</p>
	  <p>6. Devin Booker is a future MVP-caliber player.</p>
	  <p>7. The most apt modern comparison for Zion Williamson is (in-shape) Draymond Green.</p>
	  <p>8. RJ Barrett doesn't meet expectations as a rookie, makes 2nd team.</p>
	  <p>9. Warriors in 5 - bye KD.</p>
