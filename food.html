	  I had this like two Fridays ago coming back from an EE review session (shoutout HKN) and 
	  I was mentally and physically tired, just craving some pasta. I ordered the broccoli and chicken penne, 
	  which overall, I'd say was average. Not sure if La Val's emphasizes their pasta. It was tasty, but I 
	  think the benchmark for me really enjoying a meal is for me feeling like I can't replicate it myself. 
	  However, the ambiance of the place is great. I had this right after a Warriors playoff game and the 
	  TVs and pool table were a godsend. In the grand scheme, I think I put Gypsy's and Pasta Bene ahead 
	  for pasta in Berk, but this place is solid for a cheap meal with a lot of carbs. I'll try the pizza 
	  next time for sure.
