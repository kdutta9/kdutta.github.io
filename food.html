	  It's been five long, <i>cold</i> years since I've had a chicken chimichanga 
	  (mostly out of respect for the good ol cardiovascular health), so when 
	  I came back to the restaurant where I popped my chimichanga cherry, I 
	  felt an obligation to feast. I wasn't sure if Mexican food from Nevada 
	  would hold up, but overall, the food was prepared really well and was 
	  well accompanied by guac, rice, and beans. You know the meal is gas 
	  when it melts in your mouth. I'd say my only gripe was the meat was on 
	  the bland side, which is something that impacts the experience, especially 
	  since I consider myself a food connoisseur at this point after consuming 
	  some breathtaking burritos back at Cal. Overall though, this was a super 
	  solid and filling meal that hit the spot. Definitely could use more in my life.

	  I had this like two Fridays ago coming back from an EE review session (shoutout HKN) and 
	  I was mentally and physically tired, just craving some pasta. I ordered the broccoli and chicken penne, 
	  which overall, I'd say was average. Not sure if La Val's emphasizes their pasta. It was tasty, but I 
	  think the benchmark for me really enjoying a meal is for me feeling like I can't replicate it myself. 
	  However, the ambiance of the place is great. I had this right after a Warriors playoff game and the 
	  TVs and pool table were a godsend. In the grand scheme, I think I put Gypsy's and Pasta Bene ahead 
	  for pasta in Berk, but this place is solid for a cheap meal with a lot of carbs. I'll try the pizza 
	  next time for sure.
