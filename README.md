Welcome to my personal site. I forked this Jekyll template from [Point Theme](https://github.com/katavie/point-theme/).

## Building the Site on Your Machine
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Requirements

1. Install prerequisites to [run a Jekyll site locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install Jekyll and bundler gems.
 `gem install jekyll bundler`
3. Clone this repository.
`git clone git@github.com:kdutta9/kdutta9.github.io.git`

### Setup
Now we can run the site locally.
1. Pull any changes made to the repository.
`git pull origin master`
2. Build the site.
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Use browser to navigate to locally hosted site on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).
