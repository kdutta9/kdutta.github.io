      <h2>Why Did Duke Fall?</h2>
      <h5>May 4, 2019</h5>

	  This year’s Duke basketball team was ranked as the top team early in the season and carried that rank into the NCAA tournament. 
	  However, the Blue Devils faltered throughout March Madness and ended up bowing out to Michigan State in the national quarterfinals. 
	  Was the 2018-19 Duke team really deserving of the “best Duke team” and “could beat the Cavaliers” label?
	  </p>
	 
	  <p>
	  Let’s compare Duke’s regular season to that of the national champions over the past ten years 
	  (with two of those being the 2010 and 2015 Duke teams).
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart8.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  Five out of the ten had all these characteristics going into the tournament, and the only teams not to have four or greater were the 
	  2010-11 and 2013-14 Connecticut championship teams. In addition, 2011-12 Kentucky’s senior guard Darius Miles averaged 9.9 points, 
	  nearly completing the perfect 10-of-10 for that aspect of the chart. In addition, 2018-19 Duke had by far the lowest 3 point percentage 
	  rank, entering the tournament at 329th, while none of the ten champions were outside of the top 300 and six of them inside the top 50 
	  (with 2018-19 Virginia as #1 and 2017-18 Villanova as #2). 
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart9.jpg" alt="Chart" height="169" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  Against these characteristics, this year’s Duke team only stacked up to recent champions in terms of SRS (simple rating system, 
	  which takes into account strength of schedule and average point differential). A high relative SRS indicates that Duke was a 
	  talented, winning team, but a poor performance in March Madness may be attributed to a lack of overall experience, lesser offensive 
	  efficiency, and higher turnovers.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Coach Krzyzewski has headed many memorable Blue Devil squads, but some experts touted this as the best yet. We can compare these 
	  metrics for the last three championship Duke teams that have reached the national finals under Coach K, to gauge the ability of this 
	  year’s edition.
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart10.jpg" alt="Chart" height="169" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  The Duke teams fill all the metrics listed above, save for the 2000-01 Blue Devil’s need for an upperclassman guard in double figures 
	  (although senior forward Shane Battier averaged nearly 20 ppg). 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  We can also compare the SRS against the nine Blue Devil teams Kryzyzewski has taken to the finals.
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart11.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  Although this year’s Duke team had a high relative SRS, it was not exceptional 
	  compared to the other finals-qualifying squads, ranking third out of 10, and a point over the average of 25.69.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Overall, the 2018-19 Duke Blue Devils had a strong regular season team, finishing as ACC Champions and seeing the breakout of 
	  likely number one overall NBA draft pick Zion Williamson. However, they did not show signs of a “championship” team, like Virginia 
	  did. Their flaws, from high turnovers to poor shooting percentages, doomed them in the tournament, as they snuck past close games 
	  against UCF and Virginia Tech before falling to Michigan State in the regional finals.

      <h2>The Ewing Theory in 2019</h2>
      <h5>April 2, 2019</h5>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/ewing.jpg" alt="Patrick Ewing" height="350" width="350"> 
	  <img src="./docs/adavis.jpg" alt="Anthony Davis" height="350" width="350">
	  </a>
	  <p><b>Photo Credit</b>: RVR Photos/USA Today Sports (left), Tom Pennington/Getty Images (right)</p>
	  
	  <div class="entry">
	  <p>
	  The Ewing theory describes the phenomenon when a team plays better without its star player, 
	  named after former Knicks superstar Patrick Ewing, whose teams seemed to play better when 
	  he was injured or in foul trouble.
	  </p>
	 
	  <p>
	  Over this past NBA season, the Celtics have seen more success when Kyrie is not playing, for example. 
	  The Pacers have kept in the playoff race without Victor Oladipo for the second half of the season. 
	  However, some other teams have suffered without their star player, such as Anthony Davis and the 
	  Pelicans. Is the Ewing theory plausible and what circumstances cause it?
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart1.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  As seen, the Celtics have has a greater winning percentage (84.6%, 11-2 overall) 
	  when Kyrie Irving does not play, as opposed to when he does (54.0%, 34-21 overall). 
	  In contrast, the Pelicans have has a greater winning percentage (44.6%, 25-31 overall) 
	  when Anthony Davis does play, as opposed to when he does not (33.3%, 7-14 overall).
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  To explore this trend, we can compare the two players’ value over replacement player (VORP), 
	  which measures a player’s contribution to the team compared to the “replacement player” value 
	  of -2.0., calculated by taking the difference of a player’s total box plus/minus and -2.0, 
	  and multiplying it by the percentage of minutes played.
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart2.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  As shown, Davis has slightly higher VORP and win share values, but as he is ranked 10th in the 
	  league compared to Irving ranking 13th in VORP, and Davis ranking 10th compared to Irving ranking 
	  15th in win shares, further data needs to be explored to examine the Ewing theory fully.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  The Celtics and Pelicans need to be compared to determine if team trends affect play without star power. 
	  In the following chart, the net difference between the team’s statistic when the player is on the court 
	  and when the player is off the court is described for assist rate, offensive rating, defensive rating, 
	  and effective field goal percentage (which counts a three-pointer as 1.5 of a field goal).
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart3.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  As seen, the Celtics, when Irving is either out or on the bench, 
	  have a higher assist rate and defensive rating, while Davis’ absence 
	  brings lower ratings in all the above categories.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  We can examine the differences in team assist rate and defensive ratings for other star players who 
	  have missed significant time (at least 10%) this season when they are on vs. off the court, compared to 
	  the difference in win percentage with them on the court instead of off.
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart4.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  For these three players, the trend seems to hold, even though all three rank in the top 20 in the league 
	  for VORP, and Leonard is tied with Curry in win shares and ahead of James.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  To test this further, I compared Kevin Durant’s 2014-15 season, in which his injury dropped the Oklahoma City Thunder 
	  to the 9th seed with a 45-37 record after a 59-23 finish with the same team from the year prior, to Kevin Durant’s 
	  2017-18 season, in which the Warriors went undefeated in the 8 games he didn’t play when either Curry or Thompson played, 
	  and his own play caused frustrations within the team (i.e. loss to Memphis in January).
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart5.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  The trends seem to hold for the same player, further demonstrating that team statistics are a viable measure. 
	  Team make-up and strategy should factor into any Ewing theory explanations, as a lower assist rate when off the court 
	  highlights greater isolation play and a less favorable defensive rating indicates a stronger presence when a substitute 
	  is played.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  With that in mind, we can analyze the leading scorers of current playoff-bound NBA teams (for which players weren’t already examined) 
	  to assess which teams may “inexplicably” play better without them.
	  </p>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart6.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <a class="img"> 
	  <img src="./docs/chart7.jpg" alt="Chart" height="341" width="540"> 
	  </a>
	  
	  <p>
	  As seen, if the trend holds, Ewing-esque effects could happen to the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, and Houston Rockets 
	  if Blake Griffin, DeMar DeRozan, and/or James Harden, respectively, go down. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  In their five games without Griffin, the Pistons have gone 1-4, but had a late season win against the playoff-bound Portland Trail Blazers. 
	  Without DeRozan, the Spurs have gone 4-1, with their only loss against the currently top-seeded Warriors on the road. Without Harden, 
	  the Rockets have gone 2-2, although the two losses came when now-teamless Carmelo Anthony was starting, and one of those wins came 
	  against a full-strength Warriors in Oakland.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  This trend can serve to explain why some teams seem to play better without their leading scorer and others do not. Although individual 
	  statistics are similar between different cases, the supporting team’s play affects the performance without the star. If the star prevents 
	  assists and worsens the defensive play, the supporting cast may fare well without him.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  This entire analysis was done for leading scorers of teams. Teams may also play “better” without secondary players, such as Rajon Rondo’s 
	  injury in the 2012-13 season, which saw the Boston Celtics reach the playoffs and play at a higher win percentage after his departure, 
	  despite a lower assist rate and worse defensive performance in terms of defensive rating.
